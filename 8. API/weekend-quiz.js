  Quiz 1

  Requirements:
    - Create a function named `simplePromise` that returns a new promise.
    - Inside the promise, use `setTimeout` to simulate an asynchronous operation (like a delay of 2 seconds).
    - Resolve the promise with the message: "Promise resolved!" after the delay.

  Bonus:
    - Add an error condition using `Math.random()` to reject the promise with the message: "Promise rejected!" if the number is less than 0.5.
    - Use `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle the resolved and rejected cases.
*/



/*
  Quiz 2

  Requirements:
    - Create a function named `paramPromise` that returns a new promise.
    - The function will receive a parameter called `message`.
    - Inside the promise, use `setTimeout` to delay for 1 second, then resolve the promise with the `message`.

  Bonus:
    - If the `message` parameter is empty or not provided, reject the promise with the message: "No message provided!".
    - Implement `.finally()` to display a message "Operation complete" whether the promise is resolved or rejected.
*/



/*
  Quiz 3

  Requirements:
    - Fetch any API you can use then print the data using `.then()`.
    - Handle the error by using `throw` and use `catch` to receive the error message.

  Bonus:
    - Manipulate the data you get from the API before printing it.
    - Using other API than the pokemon we used is much better.
*/



/*
  Quiz 4

  Requirements:
    - Fetch any API you can use then print the data using `Async` / `Await`.
    - Handle the error by using `throw` and use `catch` to receive the error message.

  Bonus:
    - Manipulate the data you get from the API before printing it.
    - Using other API than the pokemon we used is much better.
